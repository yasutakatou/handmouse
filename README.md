While watching something while eating something, grab the mouse to bring up the next screen.
Repeatedly, my wrist hurts more and more.
This is a shadow control solution for operating a PC.
Keep your mouse closed until you finish eating!

![demo](https://github.com/yasutakatou/handmouse/blob/pic/webcamops.gif)

First annotate your figure with a webcam.

```
python record.py
```

This command activates the recording code. Two arguments. The X and Y size of the camera image.You can define up to 9 from 1-9.
The camera and the filtered video will be displayed at the same time, so make sure that the shadow is displayed.

Annotated dataset is ready.<br>

Define the operation in the config file.<br>
It is in csv format. It is defined by **the image file name and operation**.

```
1,right
```

In this case, when it is similar to 1.png, move the mouse cursor to the right.<br>
Definition for mouse operation.

|Definition|operation|
|:---|:---|
|right|Move mouse cursor right|
|left|Move mouse cursor to left|
|up|Move mouse cursor up|
|down|Move mouse cursor down|
|click|Left click|
|rclick|right click|
|dclick|Left double click|

For key input, write the character you want to input or the definition.<br>
It will be pressed at the same time when separated by a space.

```

```

Type Ctrl + w if it looks like 1.png.<br>
Below are the definitions for the keyboard.
